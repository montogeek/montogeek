# Things I would like to exist:

## Good for you:
- A blocker for any media in all platforms.

## Developer tools:
- A dynamic chart where you can put: Your app size, your build configuration and it returns how much memory is needed to make a successful build and much time it will take.
- A platform to ask question to people with specifics titles (Engineering Manager, Frontend Developer), which also explains the environment/context of the question.
- A CSS3 animation editor that supports keyframes drag and drop and SVG.
- A React Hook called `useCSSDebug()` which injects `html *, body * { outline: 1px solid rebeccapurple }`.

## Utilities
- A Reddit bookmark manager.

```bash
