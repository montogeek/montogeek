# Things I would like to exist:

## Good for you:
- A blocker for any media in all platforms.

## Developer tools:
- A dynamic chart where you can put: Your app size, your build configuration and it returns how much memory is needed to make a successful build and much time it will take.
- A platform to ask question to people with specifics titles (Engineering Manager, Frontend Developer), which also explains the environment/context of the question.

```bash
$ npm install montogeek
```
